BUGS:
[ ] Fix negative assertion.
[✓] Union types have to be put in parenthes when putting ::-type annotation.
[✓] Weird code locations spanning ridiculous number of lines.
[✓] Incorrect placement of defintions for template instantiations when emitting
    scheme.
[ ] Random failures to detect stack limit.
[✓] Match-translation predicates must account for type parameters.
[ ] Proper error reporting on invalid macro-parameter references.
[✓] Allow wildcard identifier, `_`, in local bindings.
[✓] Typecheck ignores ambiguities in function bodies.
[✓] Handle accidental infinite type-names
[ ] Assertions must not produce evaluatable code: ambiguous specializations with
    unambiguous type inference must be alowed.
[ ] Allow non-capital-patterns for matching (type matching always requires
    explicit `type` keyword)

FEATURES:
[ ] Floating point values for operator precedences.
[ ] Optimize `(begin ...)` when it contains a single expression.
[ ] Inline small functions.
[ ] REPL
[ ] Operators as constructors.
[ ] Operators in pattern matching.
[ ] User-friendly syntax for implementation of custom pattern matching
[ ] Implicit union-typing in result of match expression.
[ ] Variadic (template) arguments.
[ ] Lift functions (as types) into domain of type definitions / coercions. May
    require possibility to add predicates in (compiler) runtime.
[✓] Stringify macro-operator.
[ ] Generation of unique identifiers in macros. And, if possible, make it
    possible to share them between multiple macros.
[✓] Add character literals.
[✓] User-defined operators.
[✓] Type-annotation for multiple return values.
[ ] (?) Automatic generation of equality tests for user types
[✓] Access to top-level macro parameters during expansions of sub-patterns.
[ ] Explicit prohibition of multiple types with identical name and arity.
[ ] Type [co]variance.

TEST-FEATURES;
[ ] Automatic detection of inclusion of identical files.
[ ] Forced inlines.
[ ] Format-strings.
[ ] Externaly visible objects to enable creation of shared libraries.
[ ] Syntax to enable/disable select macros.
